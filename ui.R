										the expected value of the error), is the same.  If that's not true, then not all of 
										the error we're showing is irreducible -- there's more explaining we could do.  So if 
										the errors, for example., are getting bigger as x gets bigger, something is going on 
										in the unexplained portion of y besides just random error.  By definition -- if the errors 
										keep getting bigger, they're not being pulled from a random, normal distribution.  The

										We can use a q-q plot test for normality of errors.  Here, the q's

										evenly into a specified number of divisions.  The quantiles represent the
										values at each division line.  For example, if we divide a normal 
										distribution into four quantiles, the first quantile ends at -0.674,

										In the regression context, a q-q plot shows how the error terms from our

										distribution.  Suppose we have 11 observations.  On the y axis, the 
										q-q plot shows the 11 residuals, ordered from most negative at the bottom 
										to most
										positive at the top.  The x axis shows the values we would expect 
										at each quantile
										if we divided a normal distribution into 11 quantiles.  If our errors 
										are normally distributed, we will see a straight line positive 
										relationship between our x and y values.  If we don't, our errors are not
										normally distributed.  Note that the line shown in a q-q plot is not a
										regression line. By convention, it's a line that goes through the first
										and third quantile of the theoretical distribution.  This makes sense,
										of course, since we want to know how close our errors are to the theoretical
